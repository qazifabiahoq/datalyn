## What is Datalyn?

Datalyn is an AI-powered business analyst that continuously monitors your company’s metrics, identifies risks and opportunities, and delivers clear recommendations — in plain English.

Instead of manually checking dashboards and stitching reports across tools, you ask:

**“What’s my biggest revenue risk this month?”**

Datalyn analyzes your data, detects patterns, identifies root causes, and provides actionable recommendations — not just charts.

## The Problem

Most companies don’t lack data.
They lack clarity.

Revenue lives in one system. Customers in another. Marketing in a third.
By the time someone notices a problem, it has already impacted growth.

Dashboards show what happened.
Datalyn explains why it happened — and what to do next.

## Who It’s For

* Startup founders without a dedicated analytics team
* Operations leaders managing cross-functional metrics
* SMBs that need strategic insight without hiring a full-time analyst
* Investors who want a real-time pulse on performance risk

## Core Value

### 1. Autonomous Business Monitoring

Datalyn continuously evaluates your key metrics and flags anomalies before they escalate.

### 2. Root Cause Analysis

It doesn’t stop at surface metrics.
It connects behavior, segmentation, and historical trends to explain what’s driving change.

### 3. Actionable Recommendations

Every insight ends with a clear next step — focused on measurable impact.

### 4. Conversational Intelligence

Ask complex business questions in natural language and receive structured, transparent reasoning.

## Example: Churn Diagnosis

When asked:

**“Which segment has the highest churn?”**

Datalyn:

* Segments customers across size, tier, and region
* Identifies high-risk cohorts
* Analyzes onboarding and feature adoption patterns
* Detects churn windows in the subscription lifecycle
* Recommends targeted retention strategies

The result:
Not just churn rates — but a concrete retention plan with projected impact.

## Why It Matters

Business leaders don’t need more dashboards.
They need clarity, prioritization, and direction.

Datalyn represents a shift from passive reporting to proactive intelligence — where AI doesn’t just display metrics, but actively evaluates business health and recommends decisions.
